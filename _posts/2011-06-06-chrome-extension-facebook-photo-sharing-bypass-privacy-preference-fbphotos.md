Hey all!

Today I will publish my first Google Chrome extension: **FBPhotos**.

FBPhotos, will give you the ability to share Facebook photos between
friends (and people you may know ;) ) while they will be able to see the
photos and bypass the user's privacy preference.

**Why?**

As part of the "Facebook Family" or more correctly, another user, I hate
to admit it but I think that this issue needs to be resolved. Facebook
probably can protect my photos somehow, specially if I decided not to
show them to other users (like non Facebook users) as part of the
privacy preferences.
Please use this plugin carefully, and lets hope that Facebook will fix
this issue as soon as they can.

**We want our privacy back!**



**So how does it works?**

What I did, is just to give you the real Facebook photo URL and not the
user's profile\\photo album. lets just start ha?

1.  See a friend photo on Facebook (Wait till the photo is loaded)

2.  Click the little FBPhoto extension icon

3.  Choose your desired photo to share & Click to select it ![Facebook Photo Sharing Image 1](/assets/images/fbphotos.png "FBPhoto guide image 1")

4.  Copy to clipboard or share with your friends.
