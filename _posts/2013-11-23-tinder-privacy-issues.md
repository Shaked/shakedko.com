This is an example post demonstrating how to redirect old blog URLs to new GitHub Pages URLs.

## How This Works

This post will be accessible at the new Jekyll-generated URL:
- `/2013/11/23/tinder-privacy-issues/`

But it will also automatically redirect from the old URLs:
- `/2013/Nov/23/tinder-privacy-issues.html`
- `/2013/11/23/tinder-privacy-issues.html`

The `jekyll-redirect-from` plugin creates actual HTML files at the old URLs with meta refresh redirects pointing to the new URL.
