I was working with [Getpocket API](http://getpocket.com/developer) while coding with [Go](http://golang.org/ "The Go Programming Language") so I have decided to write a Go Getpocket SDK.

The source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/Shaked/getpocket).

Documentation is available at [Godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/Shaked/getpocket).
