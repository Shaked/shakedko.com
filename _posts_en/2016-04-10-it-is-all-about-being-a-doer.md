  A year and a half ago I have decided to go on a long trip. I ended up in Berlin after [a very interesting job hunting](/2016/03/25/job-hunting-business-and-deployment-system-part-1/). During that time, I kept thinking what should I do next and I knew that the best thing for me is to become a doer.

A year and a half ago I have decided to go on a long trip, I haven't planned it at all but I ended up living in Mexico, traveling in the United States of America for 3.5 months and of course, visiting home while freelancing for [CNature](http://www.cnature.co.il "CNature") remotely. I ended up in Berlin after [a very interesting job hunting](/2016/03/25/job-hunting-business-and-deployment-system-part-1/ "Job Hunting, Business and Deployment System #1").

During that time, I kept thinking what should I do next and I knew that the best thing **for me** is to become a doer. I have read a lot online and was mainly inspired by [Pieter Levels' post about 12 startups in 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/ "I'm Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months"). It is amazing to see people that take action, those people deserve to succeed. I can't understand people who are jealous and wish for others to fail. As a result, I have decided to take action and become a doer.

A couple of hours ago I released a new project called [#PYMWYMI](http://pymwymi.io "#PYMWYMI - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is"). [#PYMWYMI](http://pymwymi.io "#PYMWYMI - Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is") is all about putting your money where your mouth is. This idea started in a discussion with a good friend of mine and as we both disagreed about the future of Tesla we have decided to put our money where our mouth is. He is going to lose!

Lately I have been told that if you do something daily for 2 weeks, you create a routine which will take you time to get rid of. That is why I am going to start releasing projects fast even if they will fail. I might do it alone or with other business partners but it is going to be my new routine. While coding is one of my habits, I am not only going to do that but also get into other projects, like stocks investment but I will dedicate another post for that.
